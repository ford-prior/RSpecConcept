#Here's what I did to get set up:

1. Download Ruby (I did 64-bit)
2. Download Ruby DevKit
3. Unpack Devkit
3. Install RSpec & Selenium Webdriver (gem install rspec & gem install selenium-webdriver)
4. Install RubyMine
5. Open RubyMine & create new project (I did C:\Users\prior_000\RubymineProjects\{new-project}
6. In that project, create a new RSpec file and run it.
